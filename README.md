# Quick Start

For the impatient, here's how to get a boilerplate Jekyll site up and running.

```sh
~ $ gem install jekyll bundler
~ $ cd website
~/website $ bundle install
~/website $ bundle exec jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```

That's nothing, though. The real magic happens when you start creating blog
posts, using the front matter to control templates and layouts, and taking
advantage of all the awesome configuration options Jekyll makes available.

If you're running into problems, ensure you have all the [requirements
installed][Installation].
