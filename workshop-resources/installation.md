# Installation

## Choices
For Installing the software needed to work with Creative Scala. There are 3 pathways:

1. Text editor and a terminal:

   Recommended by Creative Scala tutorial


2. Intellij-Scala-Bundle:

   Significantly saves installation time

   Recommended for people who have no preference/ don't know which one to use/ have no environment setup


3. Intellij IDEA:

   Setup/ Config required

   Suitable for people who are familiar with Intellij.


### Text Editor & Terminal

#### Steps
   The [installation steps](http://www.creativescala.org/creative-scala.html#installing-terminal-software-and-a-text-editors) can be viewed in Creative Scala tutorial.

#### General Workflow

   Finding an efficient workflow is important. In Creative Scala, students are likely to run code much more frequently, and make much smaller changes, than is typical in most development workflows. I find the fastest workflow to use the `:paste` command in the Scala console. A lot of people don't know about this so here's a quick rundown of how to use it:

- Start the console, or REPL, from within SBT using the `console` command
- Use the `:paste` command to load the file of interest. In the template project this is `Example.scala`.

   The command is `:paste src/main/scala/Example.scala`. Note that tab completion works! You don't have to type this all out!

- After making a change `:paste` the file again. Note you can just press the up arrow to access previous commands in the console. No need to type it out again!


### [Intellij-Scala-Bundle](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-scala-bundle)
   The bundle saves a significant amount of time if the student do not have anything setup on the machine.

   After downloading the bundle, you can simply extract the archive and run the application.


#### Download the bundle
