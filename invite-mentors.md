# Invite Mentors for the Workshop

**Optimal start time of this step: 3 months before the workshop**


Mentors are the most important part of the workshop. It can be a little challenging if you're relatively new to the community and new to organizing ScalaBridge events. But don't worry. This page will make it easier for you, hopefully! :)


## General Process
There are **two** parts of inviting mentors.

1. The first round is that before you [pick a date](/find-date) for the event, you should personally reach out to a few people who are interested in helping out with the event by being a mentor.

2. The second round is after you've picked an event date. You can [promote the event](/promote-workshop) while attracting more mentors.

**The optimal student:mentor ratio is 5:1.**


## Who should you invite?
- People who know how to code in Scala.
- People who are interested in teaching Scala to beginners.
- People who are involved in the Scala community (doesn't have to be famous Scala people).
- People who are kind and patient.


## How do you personally reach out to mentors?
For people who already know many other Scala developers, feel free to directly reach out to them.

For people who are relatively new to the community and who are new to organizing bridge events, here are [a list of mentors](/invite-mentors), who are interested in mentoring. Feel free to invite them as mentors for your workshop.


## How do you get more mentors to sign up?
There are a few ways to promote your event:
- Twitter
- BridgeTroll
- Local Meetup


## Next Step:
- We will discuss how to find sponsorship [here](/sponsorship).

- Go back to the [main page](/organizers).
