# Promote Workshop

**Optimal start time of this step: 2 or 3 months before the workshop. This step is continuous.**


The goal of promoting the workshop is to:
1. Invite students who are underrepresented in tech
2. Invite more mentors


## Create Event
It is recommended that you choose one of the following platforms. You CAN create the event on multiple platforms, however, it will be difficult to have an accurate headcount because you might have duplicate signups from the same student.

1. Meetup

   **Here is an example of a meetup [ScalaBridge event](https://www.meetup.com/ScalaBridge-Boston/events/251183790/).**

   Advantage: broad variety of audiences


2. BridgeTroll

   **Here is an example of a BridgeTroll [ScalaBridge event](https://bridgetroll.org/events/438).**

   Advantage: BridgeTroll will send out a notification to everyone who has participated in any Bridge events before. You will be able to reach out to people who are interested/ familiar with Bridge events.
   It has really good organization tools for you to collect student info and to send notification emails.

   Disadvantage: challenging to reach out to people who are not aware of or have never participated in any bridge events.


3. Eventbrite

   Advantage: good organization tool


## What tools/platforms should you use to promote?
Know your audiences is the first step. Then promote on the platform where they are active.

ScalaBridge workshop's audiences are:
1. people who are not already in the community (students)
2. people who are in the community (mentors)


## How to promote to students?

1. **Meetup groups** Local meetup groups are great platforms for spreading the words. You can post the event registration link to the meetup group discussion. It is even better if you can send a notification email to everyone on the email list.
2. **Email lists of different groups** This is a very effective way of direct promotion of the event.
3. **Social Media** Including but not limited to: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.

## How to promote to mentors?

1. **Twitter** The Scala community is very active on Twitter. You can tweet about the event to encourage people to sign up. Feel free to mention [@ScalaBridge](https://twitter.com/ScalaBridge) in a tweet and we will be happy to retweet.
2. **BridgeTroll** Mentor on BridgeTroll will get a notification when there is a Bridge event.
3. Go to our [list of interested AMAZING mentors](/invite-mentors), and feel free to ping them for help or promoting the event!


## Next Step:
- We will discuss event reminders before the event [here](/event-reminders).
- Go back to the [main page](/organizers).
